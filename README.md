Britta is excited to prepare for the hackathon. In data analysis, a hackathon is an event where teams of analysts collaborate to work intensively on a project, using data to solve a problem. Hackathons generally last several days and teams work around the clock on their projects.
Britta needs to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use. To do this, she will follow the ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.

The Challenge was truly challenging. I wanted to stick to teh deadline, so I have submitted what I was able to do. I was unable to submit Challange 4 as I would like to spend more time on teh same.
